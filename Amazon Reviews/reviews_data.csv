The phone was opened on arrival (eg. seals were broken). Fortunately, the contents was intact.
Shipping took two more days than expected because UPS sucks and refused to make a second delivery attempt.

As for the Pixel itself, it is a great phone. I love the fact that it will have the latest android every time and it has a headphone jack! The plastic back doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. Besides, 99% of people use a case anyway. Having a glass or aluminum  back is pointless.

I'm not one to spend $1K on a flagship phone, but the camera is very important to me, which often is a problem in more budget-aimed phones. With the 3a, the camera quality is spectacular.

They've also returned the headphone jack, something I hope to see more of. Either that, or twin USB-C ports.

So far, I'd highly recommend this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

The software is very good. Their claim of 7 hours of battery life after 15 minutes of charging is a little far fetched but it is still very good and I really don't find myself needing to charge more than once per day. The fingerprint scanner can sometimes be annoying when it doesn't recognize your finger but it's not often that it happens. All in all I'm very happy with it and am glad I got it. It could however have a little bit bigger battery because if you are a heavy streamer or play games alot I could see it needing charged at least twice per day.

Pretty much all of them will have sub-par cameras, decent at best displays, and of course loads of bloatware. This makes finding a nicely priced phone for my mother a bit of a challenge because she is always after the best camera with a nice display but couldn't care less about the specs. The Pixel 3a shakes things up by going against all other budget phones; it has identical camera quality to the flagship Pixel 3 (in other words, the gold standard) a full HD OLED display and absolutely no bloatware to find! Instead the Pixel 3a forgoes the flagship processor, and and what I like to call ""XL cupholder add-ons"" (features that no one would ever say no to, but aren't necessary in a phone), so no official IP rating, no wide angle selfie camera, no wireless charging or glass back, and only one of the stereo speakers is front facing. I myself would find myself gravitating more towards OnePlus phones where performance is prioritized over things like camera quality, but for my mother and most other people out there who just want a good camera and a beautiful display, there is no better phone!

TL;DR best phone for anyone not absolutely obsessed with specs like me and uses their smartphone camera frequently (so 80% of the population)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Memory-Phone-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07R7DY911/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I had a Huawei mate 10 Pro which I got a good deal on.  What prompted me to change was that my wife wanted a phone with a better camera,  and I like the idea of guaranteed updates for 3 years.  My wife took my mate 10 Pro and I bought a pixel 3a for $399 with a $100 gift card to a store I shop often enough at to make the price for me $299 actual.

Likes:

Screen: it is a slightly above full HD screen with it being 5.6 Inch the pixels are packed tight.  I have heard some say the screen is a bit oversaturated and I am inclined to believe it.  Still, though pixel 3a has a  very sharp OLED display.  I still like my mate more even though it is not as sharp.

Performance: with a 670 snapdragon, that is about as powerful as an 835 from a couple of years ago, the performance is good.  I just realistically, can’t believe many folks would complain about this.  Storage is adequate with 64 GB.

Camera: I am not a camera pro or anywhere close.  I appreciate a good camera on a phone because it makes someone like me look like I know how to take good shots.  This camera achieves that.  I hear all the reviews that rant and rave about the pixel camera and I am just not much a camera guy to know what it all means but at the end of the day it takes good looking photos.

OS:  I have used many phones with their own Android skin on top, and it feels refreshing to use a phone with stock android.  The experience is good and I enjoy the simple user experience.

Battery life: Great.  I charge my phone every 2 days and I could probably go to 2.5 or possibly more without charging.  I use my phone lightly throughout the day.

Neutral:

Design:  the pixel 3a has a vanilla design.  It is long with large for today’s standards lower and upper bezels.  The phone is not ugly just not exciting either.  It reminds me of the older iPhone models that were not exciting compared to other phones but worked well and didn’t look unattractive either.

Build:  The phone is made of polycarbonate (plastic) which is not a problem for me, but I have used phones with better builds at this same price range. The back picks up smears easily.

Features:  there is no wireless charging, which is not a huge deal for me because I have only 1 phone with it and never used it. No waterproofing is a bummer but again not major it just means during a heavy rainstorm I have to be careful.

Dislike:
Screen rotation:  must have got the software from Sony because my biggest annoyance is the screen rotation.  When I am using my phone in portrait mode, sometimes it will just auto-rotate to landscape-way too sensitive.  I know I can turn auto-rotate off but I am used to using it.

No, hide the navigation bar:  on my mate phone, I was able to hide the nav bar when browsing which gave me extra screen real estate.

Conclusion:

I like the phone it has the early iPhone feel I mentioned earlier with just being simple to use and vanilla looking.  I like that this is a first party phone and works with other Android compatible products pretty seamlessly.  If you are like me and have used many different brands you know of the perks I have having your phone just being compatible with all things.  Nothing worse than getting the phone you want then having it be incompatible with your smartwatch, or android auto.  Stock apps just worked out of the box, like visual voice mail.  I have a pixel slate and do not suffer any glitches when linking my pixel 3s like when I would link my mate 10 Pro.  For an average everyday user, there is nothing to dislike.  It is probably not a phone for someone who wants the most premium high-end phones with the latest greatest but it does offer a focal point for those of us that want a nice phone but don’t want to break the bank.
The problem with Android, in my opinion, has been oversaturation.  There are a lot of nice phones but finding ones that work on your network, work with all features in your country and other compatibility issues can be an exercise in frustration.  The pixel 3a is a brand name phone with a mid-range price that can help with people feeling overwhelmed when shopping for a phone.  There are certainly better-looking phones, better priced, better specs, nothing but the pixel 3a puts a lot of features you want in a recognized name brand without emptying your wallet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Memory-Phone-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07R7DY911/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I paid the price with suspect quality, since I mainly bought new Android phones for that price range.  Every phone didn't last more than two years, most even started to have issues after a few months (i.e. GPS losing accuracy, charging slot losing contact, etc.)  Of course the OS never gets updated so you set yourself up to be hacked on an old, unpatched release.  The worst is the camera varying degrees of terrible.  So I bought a prepaid iPhone 6 about 1.5 years ago but you know how well iOS runs on old hardware and it will probably not make the jump to the next update.

No matter how much I tried to convince myself, I just couldn't buy a new XR, even after I sold my DSLR (b/c I just never bring it with me no matter how good the pictures/lens is/was).  However, when Google launched this phone, my last international family trip convinced me that I need to jump at the chance - pictures you have forever, you want the best camera/phone to capture your experiences.  Plus, they are offering an insane $250 trade-in for my iPhone and $100 from the Google store credit, plus my company is giving me $100 for BYOD, so the phone is essentially free to me.

Ordering was flawless, plus they (I ordered from the Google Store) provided a trade-in kit at the same time.  I got it in 2 days after Google announced it.  Box was your typical white box, looks almost exactly like a Apple box with color, design, packaging, etc.  Phone powered right up.  Slight hiccup to get it activated on Sprint in that you can't just move the nano SIM card over, you have to go to a Sprint store and activate a completely new SIM.  Also make sure it's a corporate store b/c affiliates don't seem to have these SIMs.  I went to Best Buy and they had me running in 20 minutes.

Phone is awesome.  I got the XL and it's large but for a person who wears glasses it just makes it easier to do things.  I know people say it's not fast but I don't game or edit videos so it's plenty fast/responsive.  Most importantly, the camera is awesome.  Photos are not blurry so far and super clear.  I haven't even used any of the special portrait and night options.  I'm telling you if a camera can take low light photos that is golden and why I jumped at it.  Even with a DSLR it's a challenge trying to take low light photos (do you have the right lens with a large aperture but then you can't have zoom, etc.)

It seems pretty fragile so I'm going to get some sort of case, especially since it's plastic and the case is not removable.  However, make sure you get a full case and not a case that just clips on the edges.  I made the mistake of buying one for my iPhone and sand/dirt got wedged in and ended up scratching the phone itself.  The Android OS is quite a bit different than iOS but I'm coping.  Can't say it's worst, just different.  The best part is the it being a Google phone will get updated for at least 3 years.  I have no big input on the exterior design of the outside, really all phones look the same - we have Apple to blame for that.  The fingerprint unlock is a huge plus and love it for all my iPads, computers.

Very pleased so far (will update if that changes).  Since this phone is free to me, I plan to use my $100 Google store credit to buy another Pixel 3a for my wife.  She has a 2 year old Huawei Honor 8 that has held up pretty well, aside from every government in the world banning them.

Update after 1 month
Best phone I've ever had.  Best camera I've ever had bar none, better than any Canon/Nikon DSLR I've had, etc.  I've take pictures from moving buses, etc. and each pictures looks like a million bucks...the first time.  I've used the camera for some professional portrait quality pictures.  Battery life is great.  I have had some data disconnection problems but not sure if it's a Sprint problem or otherwise but only happened a few times.  I'll monitor to see if it is a real issue.  I did end up buying a second 3a XL for spouse and she loves it too, still waiting for my google credit though...","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

The hardware itself is not that amazing, it's Google's software that makes it spectacular. A $400 phone having a camera this good is incredible.

The other reason for getting this phone is the pure Android experience. I don't care for most skins and custom UIs. Most manufacturers, however, seem to have learned that less is more when it comes to customizing the Android UI for their phones, so this is less of an issue today than it was in years past.  Having Google's guarantee of software updates is also very important to me.

One other nice feature of the phone is that it has a headphones jack, but no longer has a notification light. I'm somewhat irked by the lack of a notification light, since there's ample space on the bezel for one.

Features I'd like to have but find acceptable to be missing in a $400 phone: no wireless charging, no waterproof certification, no extra camera lenses.

What I don't quite care for on the phone: slow fingerprint reader, only 4GB of RAM.

Comparing this phone to a 2.5 year old OnePlus 3T:

1. Fingerprint reader is much faster on the 3T

2. Performance on T-Mobile is about the same as on the 3T (I moved the same SIM over to the Pixel 3a) despite the 3T lacking bands 66 and 71. It might be slightly better in some situations. For example, while I occasionally lose mobile Internet on my 3T at work (despite it saying I have LTE), I haven't encountered the same problem on the 3a.

3. Does not show ""LTE+"" for Carrier Aggregation. Not a big deal, but it's nice to know.

4. Works well most of the time, at least keeping up with the 3T. But would occasionally stutter, and would unload applications in the background more often than on the 3T (the 3T has 6GB of RAM)

In fact, it feels VERY similar to the Xiaomi Mi A1, which has Android One. The Xiaomi is about 1.5 years old, and costs half the price, and they managed to include an extra 2x optical zoom lens for the rear camera. The main drawback of the Xiaomi is that it doesn't have most of the US LTE bands, so you're stuck with 3G mobile Internet most of the time.

I was quite excited to get and use my OnePlus One, and later OnePlus 3T. This phone doesn't generate the same excitement. After using it for about 3 weeks, I find it to be an adequate phone but not amazing, except for its camera. I'd still use my DSLR for any serious photos, but it is good to know that I have a very capable picture taker in my pocket all the time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Memory-Phone-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07R7DY911/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Battery life seems pretty good. It was already charged when I received it in the mail. I didn't have to charge it for 2 days. It warned me I had 20% of battery life left. It also gave a tentative time of when the battery would be dead. At 20% I still had 5 hrs. of battery life left.
Easy transition from my Nexus 6. My Nexus had some features that this phone doesn't have yet but I was told there will be some updates rolling through this year.

I migrated from a Samsung S7 Edge and am happy with the results. It is not as much of a step up in quality ""feel"" or display but it does have a better camera and battery life. I have nothing against my Samsung Edge and have kept it as a backup phone. The price was due to my trade in of a Samsung S6 phone.

Dislikes, muting phone ring with power/volume button is hard to reverse and need to learn new menus.
I like the camera of course but also the little things like the fingerprint reader on the back and Android Pay vs Samsung Pay. Just place your index finger on the back and your ready to pay!

At times the issue was so bad that even even Google tech support calls weren't getting through despite having a strong cell signal. After spending hours on the phone with Google tech support and exchanging phones, the problems continued. Google refused to stand behind their product and would not provide a refund as we had spent over 15 days going back and forth with them to try to fix the issues and they only honor refunds within 15 days.

I'm glad I found the Pixel 3a, this is the best phone in the mid-range price out there. I know it is slightly more than my past range, but I finally wanted a phone that does more, but doesn't cost an arm and a leg. I read tons of reviews and watched several videos to make sure I'm not wasting my money (it's still a huge junk of change for me). I can say with delight, this phone is amazing.

Pros:
- The camera is wonderful, it makes great pictures in low light, at night and has so many filters and options... I can't say enough how awesome the camera is.
- The battery life is amazing, my phone only lasted through the day if I didn't do anything. This phone lasts all day even with some gaming (1-2h).
- Basic Android with minimal bloatware
- I was able to transfer almost all my data with no issues or hick-ups
- There is a headphone jack - wahooo (I guess I'm old school,  but I like it)
- I love the fast charging option, never had it before and it is great getting 70% in 20min
- Super light and compact, I do appreciate the size and that this phone is smaller than my old

Cons:
- no wireless charging

I can't say much about material, the material seems to be the same as all my old phones. My friend with an Iphone of course pointed out that it looks cheap, but really.... I don't know anything else, so I don't care. I would totally buy it again and my husband is looking forward to getting one too.

So I was thrilled to be offered a chance to review this Google Pixel phone. This one was on my shortlist of options when I was ready to upgrade because it had very good reviews, and it seemed like the best mid-range cellphone out there.

I have been very pleased with how it has performed. Setting it up was a breeze. It came with a cable that allowed me to transfer my data (including phone contacts) from the Samsung to this one. The instructions are very simple because it's very easy to set up. In fact, this has been the easiest phone to set up of any phone I've ever owned.

To complicate things, I was also in the process of changing service providers, so I was nervous that I would have some problems with that. But no. Everything went smoothly with the new provider.

Compared to the Samsung S5, the battery capability is 100% better. It holds a charge very well, and when I do charge it, it takes very little time.

I'm still exploring the features, but so far I've enjoyed using the camera. It's easy, and the quality far surpasses my previous Samsung. The colors are rich and vivid.

I've used Google apps and programs in the past and am quite happy to have a phone that flawlessly works with them. I highly recommend this phone if you're looking for a mid-range android phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Memory-Phone-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07R7DY911/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The camera, however, is beyond excellent and is straight up spectacular. Sharp, contrasty pictures with no fuss. With this phone I don't feel bad leaving my Canon at home. The ONLY thing that I don't like is that Androids don't stream to hearing aids with the ease of iPhones (I would need to buy a second device to hang around my neck using an Android).

I bought this to replace a Moto G4 Play that had served me well but was on its second battery and occasionally locked up on me requiring me to remove the battery to reboot.

As I had become a Moto fan thanks to my G4 Play, I was looking at the G7 Play and Power.  For a bit more, the G7 looked worth considering, then the Pixel 3a came out for the same price if you take the $100 gift card into account.  I read several reviews, and the better camera sold me.  I jumped in, taking the Amazon gift card offer over the Best Buy offer.

The phone looks good, still fits in my pocket and I can easily use it with one hand.  The screen looks sharp and I really like the camera after a day or two of playing a little bit.  I still need to learn more about it. I LOVE the call screening feature which I'm not sure is Pixel specific or the operating system.

I switched my service over Thursday night but needed a new, smaller SIM card which ATT gave me as I continued service with them.

Friday, I was on the phone off and on throughout the day, mostly setting it up, adding my work email and calendar, etc.  I also took a walk around my campus with it, testing out the camera on about a dozen photos.  By the time I got home from work, the battery was down to 17 percent.  17!  I had read that this didn't have a great battery, but that it would get me through the day.  5pm won't cut it.

So, what can you decide in one day?  I got up this morning, Saturday, and did some surfing, and played some online games.  Now, my game playing is limited to word puzzles and backgammon, not graphics-intensive games.  The battery, which was charged the night before, was down to 37 percent before noon.  I'm now very concerned about using this during an upcoming trip, or relying on it for work or travel.  I really like the phone, but this can't continue.  I may need to return it.  Is anyone else having battery problems like this.

On the plus side, the included charger recharges the phone pretty quickly.  But I'm not going to have the time, or outlets, to keep charging it while playing tourist.","3.0 out of 5 stars","",""

-Thoughts on the Pixel 3a XL.  Build quality is fine, but the original Pixel just feels a little better and more solid in the hand.
-Haptic feedback is also better on the original Pixel.
-The camera is great compared to my Samsung Galaxy S6, NIght Sight and Portrait Mode are great additions.

Holt","Loving this phone","May 31, 2019","I was all set to pony up $700 for the new Oneplus 7 Pro when Google formally announced the Pixel 3a and it showed up on Amazon along with a promotion that included $100 gift card. That was too good to pass up. There are tons of reviews and videos on both phones, so I won't add much here, except to comment on the two things that I had qualms about before ordering: 1) The phone feels very solid despite the plastic body. The build quality far surpasses my old plastic Nexus 5x. 2) The phone is plenty fast despite having a processor that is on paper inferior to the ones in the Oneplus 7 Pro and other expensive phones. If you don't have another phone to compare to it right next it, you won't notice any limitations in processing.

So I'm really pleased with this purchase, and I'd say it would still be worth it even without the $100 gift card thrown in.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Memory-Phone-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07R7DY911/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I had a Google Pixel 3 (non-XL) and previously had a Google Pixel 1. Google makes great phones that offer good value and a killer camera and the purest android experience. Previously, my mom has been having problems with her older (LG G5 and previous phones as well) always getting slow and buggy over time. This happens, I find, far slower with a pure android experience and the constant, fast updates that Google offers for their phones directly.

With the newly released Pixel 3a, being a budget, yet not significantly slower version of the Pixel 3, I knew this was a good deal and an excellent phone choice for my mom. Had this been available when I first was getting my phone, I would have gotten it as well instead of the Pixel 3. Many agree, that the Pixel 3a is a good enough phone that offers value without compromising too much. While you can sometimes notice it being slightly slower, the average use and consumer will not.

While it might not have the best specs at this price, I am willing to take a CPU downgrade in order to have the best user and camera experience on a phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Memory-Phone-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07R7DY911/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Little things in terms of ease of use that aren't that easy to quantify. But you also get a lot of integrated features from Google that I've become a big fan of - Google Assistant has proved more useful for someone like me who doesn't like to talk to his phone than Siri ever did.
But for the dollar value I don't have a single regret. I happily forewent niceties like wireless charging and waterproofing to get this cheaper version of the Pixel 3, and it doesn't feel cheap in terms of construction and durability. I needed something with a built in headphone jack to be compatible with my car stereo, which is what drew me to the Pixel 3a in the first place.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Memory-Phone-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07R7DY911/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

You should know one thing going into buying the Pixel 3a: it comes with Google's Pixel launcher, meaning that the interface that you're probably use to with other phones (Samsung, Xperia, iPhone, whatever else) is different here. It's a lot simpler to use, and keep in mind if you don't like it, you can download something different from the Play Store.

Photos look excellent in my opinion (see my attached photo), navigating around the phone and apps works very quickly, and cell service (T-Mobile) has worked perfectly so far. The phone doesn't have much grip to it, so I recommend buying a case for it.

Overall, great phone!","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

Most notable is the quality camera that is used and the flat screen rather than the curved screen on Samsung phones.  Also notable is that you are getting pure android and not someone's proprietary apps and bloat.  One negative is that it is not the latest greatest processor but rather a upper middle of the road one.  The other negatives is the high price to get it unlocked if not activating with a carrier.  Why should it cost a hundred dollars more without activation, especially when several places were offering pre-sale gift cards worth 100 dollars.  I put the item in my cart which included a 100 Amazon gift card, but when I went to purchase it indicated that the gift-card offer was no longer available.

Mohiuddin","Google returns to its senses and offers a high value product","June 26, 2019","What is differentiates the phone these days? If your answer is the bezel or the 'notch', this phone may not appeal to you. But for someone like me, who likes a simple phone with a great screen and an excellent camera at a reasonable price, Pixel 3A came out at the very top of the list.
  The screen is a stunning OLED screen with the highest resolution that my eye can discern. It is very almost impossible to see individual pixels and the images look crisp, with a great contrast ratio.  As a result, the pictures look amazing and reading on the screen is a joy.
 The best part of the phone is a great camera that takes great pictures. To me, this is the big differentiating factor among phones these days. All phones are more or less the same on other commonly used features. The pictures are really excellent, with almost an DSLR-level quality to them.
 A true Android OS with no wizardry programmed on top of the OS means that the system is very simple, yet fully functional. You may have to download some apps that you are used to, but this simplicity makes the phone very appealing to me.
 There is only one drawback on the phone: Lack of an external SD memory storage.  Perhaps one doesn't need a lot of storage if we store all our data on the cloud, but lack of an external memory option is nevertheless disappointing.
In summary, if you value your hard earned money enough not to throw it on gimmicks like the 'Notch free screen',  'edge screens' or some random sensor (that you probably would never use), Pixel 3A should rank very high on your list.

Over the past 4-5 years, phones have rapidly evolved, perfected and commoditized. Phone manufacturers rely on customers paying premiums for gimmickry to keep their margins elevated. There is no reason to pay $1000 for a phone which can do very little that is different from a $300-$400 phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Memory-Phone-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07R7DY911/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I upgrade my smartphone every 8-12 months so I'm no stranger to using different phones, ranging from Google phones like the galaxy nexus, to the Nexus 6p as well as a Galaxy Note 3 and lately I've been on a good run of oneplus phones.

My wife likes to hang onto her phones and also wants a smaller form factor. The pixel 3a is a welcomed entry in the smartphone world. Even though I've never used a Pixel 3 I have used a pixel 1 and 2,and I can say this 3a feels as fast as those phones. Sometimes specs aren't the while story. Regardless if this doesn't have top specs or a 4k display it feels premium, it feels fast, it looks great, and the camera is top notch.

If you are on a budget this should be your choice. Nothing else comes close to the 3a's quality for $399. Pure Android is a treat if you've ever esperienced a horrible UI like LG's or Samsung, then you are missing out on pure Android. 3 years of support promised from Google is perfect as most people will replace their phone every 18-24 months but if you want to hold on just a little longer, Google has you covered.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Memory-Phone-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07R7DY911/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

And some things were really slick. But this phone is fundamentally flawed. The Pixel 3a fails at a couple critical things every phone can do (even my old iPhone).
(1) Creates a really inconsistent / wonky connection with Honda Bluetooth systems, making it unusable. [Google’s suggestion was that I should sell my couple-year-old Honda and buy a new car with Android Auto. Thanks… that’s helpful…]
(2) Doesn’t switch to cellular data backup when the internet connection coming through WiFi is weak / not functioning.
[Tested on multiple WiFi networks, side-by-side with an iPhone that had no issues.]
I spent no less than 3 days and 5 hours on the phone with Google trying everything and resetting the phone. Google eventually took it back. In the process, Google dragged its feet on responding to me until my trade-in phone had been irretrievably lost in their system, and now they’re refusing to give me market value for my phone.

That doesn't even get a list of this device's pros started. It's built and maintained by Google with guaranteed updates for three-years. There is hardly a noticeable difference between I and it's pricier sibling and if you have the Google branded case applied, anyone on the street would be hard-pressed to tell the two apart based on aesthetics alone. Once you pick it up, there still is not a notable difference in day to day use, or speed doing all the phone things that phones do. This device might be a hair slower to process certain tasks, but not enough to discount it's nearly halved price tag.
Before this phone I used the Moto G7, and while a great feeling phone, I chose to keep the pixel 3a as my daily driver and have the G7 to a family member who now also has one of the top budget phones. The G7 just doesn't have that Pixel wow, that kept me picking it up over the latter.
Hopefully Google will continue this trend with a Pixel 4a, if I can keep from picking up the Pixel 4 after rejoining the Pixel family after the Nexus program began to flop miserably. This 3a though, is reminiscent of the Nexus glory days of the Nexus 4 and 5x.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Memory-Phone-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07R7DY911/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Hands down, the best full-featured smartphone you can get in its price range.","June 27, 2019","OK, this is gonna be the easiest phone review I've ever written:

With the Pixel 3a, Google has redefined the mid-line smartphone. While there are somewhat better phones available for much more money, and worse phones available considerably cheaper, this is a smartphone that will satisfy the vast majority of users, available at about 2/3 to 1/2 the price of anything even remotely worth considering as an upgrade.

Usually I save the punchline for the end, after a long look at features and quality. But in this case, I wanted to lead with conclusion, because it's just so obvious.

There have been about a billion articles written that list the basic specs of this phone, so I'm not going to repeat those here. But I will summarize just what makes this phone so appealing.

I have also attached some photos to put a point on some of my comments. In particular see the comparisons of how the camera on this phone does in difficult low light ""dusk"" conditions. It blows away the comparison cameras on phones like the iPhone 8 and Motorola's previous flagship the Z2 Force. (And new flagships aren't that much better).

Let me start by saying that what people want in a smartphone, no matter what nonsense the hardware manufacturers are trying to sell, are the following:

A) Good phone reception
B) Full support of the major carriers
C) Fluid experience (apps open quickly, run properly, no unnecessary heavy OS tweaks or bloatware)
D) Sufficient integrated flash storage
E) A good camera
F) A screen that's ""big enough"" and that looks good

That's it. Sure, there are niceties like a fingerprint reader, waterproofing, memory expansion, and whatever they're hyping this year, but if you meet A-F, you have phone you'll be happy to use.

The Pixel 3a meets all of the A-F criteria. In a head-to-head with a thousand dollar iPhone or Samsung phone would it win? No. But as Voltaire said ""don't let the best be the enemy of the good."" Especially if that money is coming out of your pocket.

Running down the specifics:

A) Phone Reception. The Pixel 3a gets good phone reception. In the era of Smartphones, that often gets overlooked. I've had expensive feature-laden smartphones that could barely maintain a signal once you left good signal areas. The Pixel holds its own. Is it as good as my Motorola Z2 Force (Motorola is known for particularly good reception)? No, not quite. But the difference is small enough to not worry about.

B) Full support of the major carriers. One thing that's really nice about the Pixel 3a is that it works PROPERLY with all the carriers. A lot of ""unlocked"" phones will work with the various carriers, but will fail to set up properly to run the proprietary apps that belong to the carrier. For example, I have had numerous unlocked phones that did not correctly set up with a T-Mobile SIM (my carrier) to support their voLTE (phone+data) or voice messaging services. The Pixel 3a just...works...Put in your carrier's SIM card and it sets up the necessary functionality for your carrier (at least in the USA).

C) Fluid Experience. Yup, it's plenty fluid. A lot of people have bemoaned that this phone is based on the Snapdragon 670 processor, rather than the Snapdragon 8x5 series processors found in flagship phones like the big brother Pixel, the Samsung S10 and so on. But a lot of that is ignorant processor envy. The reality is that in day-to-day operation, the 670 offers performance that would be difficult to differentiate from the 8x5 series. Sure, if you run synthetic benchmarks, the 8x5 looks better. But if you are the typical user who uses your Smartphone for email, surfing, maps and the occasional game, you are not going to know the difference--especially since Google has done an outstanding job of tuning the Android backend to maximize performance with the 670.

D) Sufficient integrated storage. Yup. You get 64Gb of storage. That's not enough to set the world on fire these days (flagships mostly start at 128Gb). But it's enough to store just about everything and anything you should be storing on your phone. If you are the kind of person whose phone is running out of space because of too many pictures and videos, look into Google Photos, where you can upload your photos for free and get them off your phone.

E) A good camera. Yes!!!! Not only a good camera, but within a hair's breath of the very best camera you can get on a smartphone. The very best camera award currently belongs to the big brother Pixel 3, which has a second lens for some special effects, and a Pixel Visual Core co-processor which means that photos process a little more quickly. But in terms of just quality, the Pixel 3a has as good a camera as ANYONE, and a MUCH better camera than most, including the flagships from brands not named Samsung or iPhone. It's also arguably better than their flagship cameras, although it's not worth going down that rabbit hole right now. What makes it so good? OIS (optical image stabilization) that really works. Accurate colors. Low light performance (in something Google calls ""NightSight mode"") that is nothing short of amazing. (See the pictures I've attached for proof). This is the first time in smartphone history that a camera that could legitimately be called best appears on a mid-line smartphone. That's amazing.

F) Big enough screen. Good enough screen. I'll start with good enough. The screen is bright and readable even in sunlight. It has 2220x1080 resolution, which is not the best of any smartphone, but it's very good, especially given the moderate screen size of 5.6"". No one who isn't into specs or very very niche apps will be unhappy with the resolution. Is it big enough? Well, that's gonna come down to taste. What I can say is that this is a perfect size for one-handed operation. If you are one of a very large number of people who bemoan the days when you could actually operate your smartphone with one hand, the size of this phone is probably your sweet spot--at least of the currently supported sizes among leading Android manufacturers. If, on the other hand, you're a more-is-more person who wants as much on the screen as possible, then you may be better suited to the Pixel 3a XL (exact same as this phone, except a bigger 6.0"" screen), or the Pixel 3 XL (6.3"") or maybe one of those ""what the heck is that tablet you have on your ear"" things from Samsung. But for the vast majority of people, the size of this phone is going to be quite satisfactory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So this phone hits all the important high points. But, wait, there's more:

A fingerprint reader (located in the center of the back) that is very responsive and accurate.

A headphone jack (!!!) Yes! They brought the headphone jack. Why they ever got rid of it is a mystery of ""hey Apple did it maybe we should too"" proportions. Since 3a seems to be the ""people's Pixel"" it makes sense they'd bring back the jack. That means you can use your old wired headphones, if you didn't already shift to Bluetooth. And if you shifted to Bluetooth, this phone can work with those, too. Options...what a concept.

4Gb RAM. One way a lot of phone manufacturers cheap out on their mid and low line phones is by providing less than 4Gb of RAM. 4Gb RAM is the sweet spot for Android. You don't really need any more. But if you have less, you can find your phone bogged down when you have multiple apps open. So it's nice that the Pixel 3a has a flagship-worthy 4Gb.

The battery is 3000 mAh, which a few years ago would have been jaw-droppingly great, but is 15-25% less than some of today's flagships. That said, because the screen is smaller and the 670 processor is less power hungry, you actually get good life out of that battery. I am pretty hard on my phone, and tend to get a day out of a full charge, although by the end of the day I'm in that stressful < 20% range. I did a power consumption when just sitting around test, shown in the pictures. I got about 64 hours of use out of it in that case before it hit 10% and went into deep battery saving mode. That's not bad at all.

Supports fast charging. I was able to fully charge the battery from 10% back to 100% in a little over 1.5 hours of fast charging. If you just need a top off, you can get a double digit increase in the charge with just 15 minutes. (The last bit of charge to 100% is always the hardest/slowest).

Little niceties like squeezing the sides of the phone to open Google Assistant, and double tapping the screen to unlock it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK, so at this point you may be wondering what are the downsides of this phone? You've got a grand burning a hole in your pocket? Can't I provide some reasons to waste it on a double priced flagship?

Well, here are the downsides:

This Pixel 3a does not support wireless charging. This is a drag. I love wireless charging: I set my phone on a wireless charging stand next to the bed and in the morning it's fully charged. I'm sad they didn't include wireless charging here.

The Pixel 3a is not waterproof or certified water resistant. If you are the type of person prone to dropping their phone in the toilet or the pool, this may not be the phone for you. I am not that kind of person, so that's OK with me.

There's no memory expansion. You get your 64Gb and that's it. There's no memory slot to expand the memory. I don't think this is a deal killer unless you keep your entire song library or movie collection on your phone. But it's worth noting.

The phone is made of plastic. It looks pretty, but it's plastic. Upside: It won't break like a glass case. Downside: It's plastic. Somewhere, sea life just shed a tear. But once you put a case on it (and who doesn't use a case?) what difference does it make? It's like all the nonsense about whose phone is 0.001 mm thinner. Who cares? The case makes that irrelevant.

The phone has only 1 front facing speaker. That means mono. But before you boo-hoo, when is the last time you got the sense of great stereo separation from your flagship phone with stereo speakers? Maybe never? The speaker on the 3a is plenty loud and to me that's far more important than whether I might every be able to hear a stereo signal from it's (like all other smartphones) tinny speaker.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To summarize, there is a lot to like, some to love, and precious little to bemoan about the Pixel 3a (for me, probably the biggest moan point is the lack of wireless charging). A phone like this would have been a flagship a few years ago. Now it is within shouting distance of the relevant feature set of this year's flagships. And it has a better camera than almost all of them.

If you really want to save money, and you're willing to give up important features and experience, then you should look at the low end Motorola phones, which offer real value in that segment. If you have double the money the Pixel 3a costs and you just have a burning desire to throw sense out the window (or you really have to have a bigger screen), then look at Pixel 3 or the Samsung flagships or (if you must) the iPhone flagships.

For everyone else, the Pixel 3a is where it's at.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Memory-Phone-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07R7DY911/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But I was pleasantly surprised to see good build quality and the materials feel as if they belong on a more expensive phone. Camera quality is great and Google has made it clear that they will prioritize software over hardware, as far as camera is concerned, to deliver good quality.

I only gave this four stars, for now, because of a couple oddities. I have only had this for two days.
1. Unlike virtually every other phone, there is no way to set up speed dial numbers on the keypad. You can set up your contact list to put favorites on top. Also create widgets that when you press on them dial the number that is programmed with that particular widget.
2. I could find no detailed manual that describes many of the capabilities and how to set them up.
3. There is no way to set up the phone to answer automatically after a particular number of rings. You have to physically touch the phone to answer. For those of us who wear Bluetooth headsets, and especially hearing aids with Bluetooth, this is a great feature. I just discovered that I can take calls by simply pressing on the Bluetooth.
4. There does not seem to be any way to adjust the sensitivity when touching the screen. I bought their screen protector which seems to be glass rather than a plastic film. I wonder if that is affecting the sensitivity of the screen?

Larsen","So far so good - but I wonder for how long","June 21, 2019","My old Pixel1 died - or rather the battery did, and well you cannot replace it without spending ""half a phone"" on it.  I don't think any phone is worth $1000+ so I was happy that Google offered the 3a which has plenty of capacity for what I use my phone for for a reasonable price.  I went from having 15-30 minutes of phone time on a full charge to days.

The process of copying data over failed because the old phone could not keep a charge long enough for the process to complete. With the help of Google support, I did a phone restore from the cloud instead, but this does not include _all_ data/apps. So the process of migrating from old to new phone, even within Google's own systems, was far from optimal and successful. Google support was very helpful of at least getting an operational phone with 85-90% of all features installed.

You just need patience - every app have to be downloaded, you have to re-authorize/authenticate everything - and if you like me use apps for OTP, you'll have to create all new keys.

Feature wise I like the XL size better then the original size. The ""press for google assistant"" sucks and will soon be disabled. I love the finger-print authentication, I used that a lot on Pixel1 too and it's still easy to use. Camera works, even thought he google app for taking photos is getting worse.

The driving-mode feature sorta worked on the old Pixel, but it's like it has all new life on Pixel3a. The only problem is that it's over aggressive. Sitting on a plane I had to constantly turn it off as we taxied to take off (airplane mode does not disable GPS). But in my car it's GREAT - I start playing podcasts, set my destination and as I drive out the garage the drive-app activates and now incoming calls are ""restricted"" and full hands-free works great. The old pixel, this was all a manual process - and it would get confused at times and refuse to stop podcasts when calls came in.

Given my experience with the pixel1 I'm unsure of the longevity of this phone. It has the same design fault not giving you access to the battery without a lot of special tools or spending quite a lot of money to have someone else do it. The next battery failure will be the last one for Pixel - at least for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Memory-Phone-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07R7DY911/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Some more pros, Google photos back up is unlimited, 3 times the amount of cloud storage for free as apple, and they keep pictures completely separate.

-Pure Android
-Great Battery Life
-Clean design; no goofy edges or notches, no giant chin
-Great performance

-Cons-

-Weak speakers

I was in the market for an efficient, well-designed, pure Android phone without a lot of gee-whiz bells and whistles, and I found exactly what I was looking for with the Pixel 3a XL. It has great performance, at least compared to my previous phone, the galaxy S7 edge, and plenty of storage for my needs at 64 GB. The only real drawback that I've encountered so far is the speakers. The sound is pretty weak, but you can't have everything at this price. I'm more than happy, and I'm very glad to say goodbye to my galaxy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Memory-Phone-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07R7DY911/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

No thrill.","June 17, 2019","I'm not one of those phone fanatics always getting the latest and greatest flagship phone. In fact, I was using my HTC M8 until recently which was 4+ yrs old. I had to replace the HTC battery twice and the micro usb port like 3 times. It was just time to let it go. Even to the very end I was able to play mobile games like Marvel Future Fight on a 4 yr old phone.

Now when it comes to getting a new phone I wanted a vanilla phone like the Android Ones or the Pixel line due to the fact that manufacturers of phones are notoriously slow in updating their phones which poses security and vulnerability issues.  Not google Pixel. Updates are pushed when it's officially release.

So Pixel was my choice after review different options. Not only was the Pixel 3a and 3a XL perfectly time for me it wasn't going to rob me blind.

What I like:
-Superb camera taking
-Finger security is awesomely convenient
-Snappy
-Android Updates
-Battery life is long!
-USB C (must have USBC 18w chargers to optimize charging speed)

Not so awesome:
-Bland design
-Not edge to edge with notch display but for the prize that's expected
-Buying USB C wall and car chargers to utilize fast charging","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Memory-Phone-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07R7DY911/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The camera is superb - on a par with much more expensive phones!  It doesn't have the usually installed bloatware found on most other phones (even NO facebook, yay!), but there is a lot of Google software that you will want to review before using.  Be careful with giving the Google apps permissions if you have security/privacy concerns - true on any phone.  Though the phone is constructed with polycarbonate materials, not glass or metal, it still feels great in my hand with a good solid feel to its construction.  Finally, the pure Google Pie operating system is a joy to use!

Here are the list of differences compared to the Pixel 3 (original).

1. Camera.
Best camera at this price point
Same rear facing camera. One of the best, if not the best smart phone cameras out there in the market.
Camera hardware is toned down. If you use 3rd party camera apps you may not get HDR+
Takes a few seconds longer for post processing to finish; not an issue unless you take multiple pictures in quick session then try compare them
There's no duel camera on the front. So no wide angle selfies
Unlimited storage at high quality with Google Photos to cloud for 3 years

2. Plastic Body
Doesn't feel as preinum, but may not feel the urge to buy a case for it right away.

3. Has a Headphone Jack
Can use wired headhphone on it with a 3.5mm headphone jack. No adapter needed.
Has Bluetooth 5.0 for those who have switch over to wireless lifestyle.

4. No Pixel Buds
Unlike the original, does not come with Pixel Buds out of the box. Not even wired headset

5. No Wireless Charging

6. Longer Battery life
Has larger battery and faster charge time than orginal

7. No Front Facing Speaker.

Instead speakers are on the bottom of the phone. Makes it less emesrive/loud when playing audio from device.

8. No water resistance
Careful not dropping it in a pool or toiliet

9. Has mid teir processer: Snapdragon 670 with 4GB RAM. Good enough for casual use. If you play a lot of mobile games or multitask with duel screens, you may see notice some slowdown if you're used to high end smart phones.

10. More carriers selling phone. Original only sold at Verizon
Like other Pixel, Google phones; it is an unlocked phone so can use it on any carrier.

11. Missing 3rd mic
Lower audio pickup and noise reduction

12. Larger size physcially than Pixel 3 despite it having lower specs

13. Screen
Has OLED screen vs LCD like the original, but not as bright.
443ppi original vs 441ppi for 3a
Has dragon trail glass vs gorillia glass. Both are different manufactures with different names. Durablity should be almost the same

14. No facial regonition software
Must use finger print sensor, number code or pattern.
Finger print sensor is top notch and quick like all other Pixel phones

Misc info:
Google Software. You get stock andriod and access to most frequent security and firmware updates from Google. Guarenteed 3 years updates according to Google

Still get active edge- squeeze to activate Google Assistant

Overall, I say very good budget phone if you want one of the best camera and first access to Andriod updates at an affordable price with some compromises. Very good value for what you get.","4.0 out of 5 stars","",""

This phone is perfect for 99% of people (there are even great $300 phones now that would satisfy 75% of people!).  Anyway, for the past few years, I've paid cash for my phones and used them on prepaid networks to save money. Pre-Pixel 3a XL I had a Moto G7, which is a good phone on paper, especially for $300, but it was filled with buggy software issues. So I 'splurged' (for me) and got the 3a XL.  The biggest standout of this phone is the excellent camera, especially if you like landscape shots (mountains, sunsets, etc). The colors pop just right and the clarity is amazing. It is also a fast camera with no processing lag post-shot. There are some cool features baked into the phone but I think what most people will find great is the cam. The two minor downsides are, there is no micro-SD expansion slot, and the bezels around the screen are big for 2019. I knew that going into it, and neither is a deal breaker for me.  Otherwise, the 3a/XL is plenty fast (it actually feels faster than it should - I've read that Google has excellent software optimization). Everything works as it should. Bluetooth connects fast to all my devices.  And just to give you an example as to a major benefit of a Google device - if a bug is found, there is a forum to post about it, and the developers post updates on the resolution.  I didn't buy this phone from Amazon, but when I find a product or service I feel strongly about, I like to share my experience. I highly recommend anyone looking for a new phone check out the 3a or 3a XL. Even if you think you *need* a Galaxy S10, you probably don't. Check this one out first. Save yourself the $500 and spend it on some other tech toy instead.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Memory-Phone-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07R7DY911/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

- Battery life is fantastic! Easily gets 6hr SoT
- Camera is the same as the Pixel 3. Meaning, one of the best cameras for uner $400
- Smooth and fluid. I was afraid it would lag cause of the SD670 and 4gb of ram but I feel its smoother than the Pixel 3
- The phone is light and feels nice in the hand. The plastic is high quality but feels great
- Fast Android updates
- Headphone jack
- Dual speakers (earpiece and one bottom firing)
- FP scanner is fast.
- 3 years of Android/security updates

Cons:
- No IP rating
- EMMC storage speed
- High quality photo storage vs original
- No Pixel visual core
- Dragon trail glass not gorilla glass
- Not a flagship SoC, so hardcore gaming will be a bit slower than a $700+ phone

See, the cameras on midrange phones tend to never be as good as the flagship phone's cameras of even a few years back. So when the Pixel 2 was out, I was still on my Moto X. Moto X was older, yes, but still had a decent camera for the time and an OLED screen.

Finally today we have the option of the Pixel 3a. A device with an OLED screen, IMO the best cellphone camera on the market, and a midrange prcoessor. This bringing the price down to a point that I saw it as entirely afforable.

Headphone jack, no goofy notch, but still doesn't look severely old. It's honestly a return to the Nexus style model, and I'm in love with it.

The only negative reviews I see are people complaining that it doesn't have all the features of the $800 phone. Of course it doesn't!

Nguyen","Amazing camera and battery life","June 16, 2019","Coming off from an LG g5, this phone is a big upgrade even though it's a mid level phone. I traded the LG to get the pixel 3a via TMobile.

Pros:

- Always get the latest Android

- No bloat ware from TMobile

- Camera quality is great compared to my previous phone. This is especially helpful when depositing checks.

- Apps like Tesla actually works much better.

- Even though it uses a budget processor, the apps and phone's functions are very snappy (Android system on Android phone helps?)

- Battery is amazing and the fast charging is as promised. I only need to charge the phone for about 30 minutes or so to get to from 50 to 90%. This will last about a day worth of light usage or half a day worth more screen time.

I've used this phone for about a month, but I've little drawbacks.

- The display is great with improved clarity and sharpness compared to the older LG.

- Keyboard and swiping function is much better compared to the LG.

Con:

- No option for turning off the screen with double-tap? I can only use the power button to execute this function.

- Can't think of another but will update is anything arises.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Memory-Phone-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07R7DY911/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pros: low cost, incredible camera, Google ecosystem, battery life, headphone jack.
Cons: slightly buggy phone app, cheaper materials, not quite waterproof, lack of wireless charging, no earbuds included.

I was a bit hesitant to risk upgrading, but I'm so glad that I did. I bought the 3A XL in Purple-ish, and the color is gorgeous. The battery life has been great, surprisingly better than my Pixel 2XL. Please note that I did disable some digital wellbeing features within an hour of initial setup, which has increased the speed and saved some battery. The display is nice, and bringing back the headphone jack was a pleasant surprise (I don't know about you but I was CONSTANTLY losing my 'dongle' when I actually needed it).

However, there are a few major features lacking on this model vs the 3XL, primarily lack of wireless charging and waterproofing. Another major difference is the materials are definitely cheaper. It doesn't look or feel as cheaply made as say, the iPhone 5C did. The back simply doesn't have quite the same glow as the 2XL or 3XL. I would definitely recommend getting a screen protector on the device immediately before use, as the glass on the front isn't as durable. That said, it doesn't really look or feel cheap, just not built as premium as other Pixel devices.

I could probably write an entire page about how incredible the camera is, but it's something you really just need to experience for yourself. Night Sight blew my mind. I took pictures of my living room in nearly pitch black darkness and a) I was able to see more in the photo than I could with my naked eye in the dark and b) it honestly looked like the time of day the photo was taken was about 4pm with the amount of light in the image. Portrait mode on any Pixel is fantastic. I have been asked if many pictures that I have taken on Pixel phones are professional photographs, and I am really not the best photographer.

I do feel the need to mention that the phone app still has some kinks to work out, but I'm confident from my past experience with Google that it won't be long before its fixed. I have noticed that sometimes on calls, the phone has issues with displaying contact names on screen when I switch from one call to another. Luckily, there is an option built into the device's settings to immediately talk with Google support live agents via chat. I did this with ZERO wait time. Super helpful!

Considering upgrading from an iPhone? I would recommend ignoring other online reviews that advise you against it and just go for it. (Just remember if you have a newer iPhone, make sure to compare features on your current device such as wireless charging first). My inital experience going from Apple to Google (iPhone to the Pixel 2XL) was seamless. Everything transferred via the cord and adapter given in the box. (Minus my collection of Apple music of course, but that's what Spotify is for!)

New to Google? The Google ecosystem works incredibly well as a whole. I have Google smart home products in my home, and use Google photos and Gmail/google calendar/g suite etc. I'm amazed every day by new ways that everything works together.

Lastly, THE PRICE! A new release, good quality phone at this low of a cost? It's a GAME CHANGER. This was the deciding factor for me choosing to upgrade, and it's absolutely worth the cost. In fact, a phone with this good of a camera at this cost is basically a steal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

It arrived 6/3 and the microphone stopped working 6/4 and am having it refunded on 6/5.

I got called from a potential employer twice and they couldn't hear me. They wasted 7 hours of my time.

Purchased from the Google store.

I had 6 interactions where Google couldn't identify the problem before saying it'd take 2-7 days to ship a replacement.
I asked if they could simply overnight it, or give me a two year warranty, or literally anything since they are selling faulty phones. Long story short, it's their 3rd generation of phones and they still can't get it right, and they don't even want to try.

I really didn't pay much to it until my co worker told me about it. I decided to see his Pixel phone hands on. I'm quite impressed for hundreds of dollars less you get all the same features in a smart phone that apple and Samsung has out as well. Google does better service then others. You don't really need animoji and other necessities that apple and Samsung charge to us consumers. Night mode on the camera is awesome don't really need to use flash. If you are a Google user as myself then this phone will feel just right. Having home devices connected to Google such as the Google mini and watches makes them easier to use. Best of all is the storage. While Apple and Samsung use phone storage to save photos and videos, Google gives you unlimited data space in their cloud service so every time you snap a picture or videos it gets automatically synced to their service which allows you to have more storage on your device. Oooh and did I mention the phone is only $399!!!!!! Check out the Google store online more information and specs honestly you rather spend over $1000 or $399 you do the math.

I've had the phone for about a week and absolutely love it. It has every feature you could possibly want (except for waterproof and wireless charging) at a completely reasonable price. Google spent money where it actually matters with this phone and I believe they made perfect choices.

+ OLED screen, looks better than my Pixel XL
+ Camera, no expense spared,
+ Build quality is excellent, plastic does not feel cheap and can take a beating when you drop it. (why everyone thinks they need solid glass phones or 'titanium' build is beyond me).
+ Battery life is FANTASTIC. They really paid attention to this one and it shows.
+ Processor speed is zippy for all that you need to do. Yes, they didn't put the latest and greatest processors inside but they opted for a slightly older (but still great) processor that consumes less battery.  In my opinion, I would rather have a longer battery life with a great processor than terrible battery life with an advanced just released-processor. Unless you are filming 4k while playing a 3D video game you won't even notice.
+ headphone jack
+ no notch

Negatives:
Not waterproof and no wireless charging, both 2 things I can completely live without.
I have no other negative comments or thoughts, the phone is that good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Memory-Phone-Unlocked/product-reviews/B07R7DY911/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Really, the only trade-off in my mind is design. It's not the absolute sexiest piece of hardware around (the screen bezels are pretty big compared to most other recent generation flagship phones). But it's less than half the price of those phones, and that's literally the only downside. It probably performs better in almost every other way (especially the camera and the battery).
